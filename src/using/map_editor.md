# Map Editor

PICO-8's map tiles use the 8x8 sprites from the Sprite Editor. This means 16x16
tiles will fill an entire screen.

Even though you can have a maximum map size of 128 tiles wide and 64 tiles
tall, the lower half of the map actually shares space with the last two tabs of
the Sprite Editor. So you need to decide if you want a large map or if you want
a lot of sprites.  No matter what is drawn in sprite #0, that sprite is used as
an "eraser" sprite. You can use it to erase map tiles.
