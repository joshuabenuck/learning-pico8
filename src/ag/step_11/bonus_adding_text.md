# Bonus Step: Adding Text
This step will be a bit more involved than the previous steps. If you have
made it to this step, you will definitely be able to complete it. Just take
it slow and don't rush.

In `map_setup`, we have an unused sprite type (`5`). We are going to use this
to trigger the display of text to the user.

This opens up a world of possibilities. It allows to add Non-Player Characters
(NPCs) that can speak with your character. Signs can provide instructions or
warnings. You are able to tell your character's back story through dialog or notes or other narrative devices.
