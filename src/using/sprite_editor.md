# Sprite Editor

Sprites are the pieces of art that make up your game. They might be
characters, map tiles, pickups, titles, backgrounds, anything. PICO-8 allows
you to have 256 8x8 sprites. These are split across 4 tabs labeled 0-3.
However, the last two tabs are shared with the Map Editor. So if you have a
really big map, you won't be able to use the last two tabs of sprites. But if
you're using the last two tabs of sprites, you won't be able to use the lower
half of the Map Editor.
