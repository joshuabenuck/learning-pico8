# Using PICO-8

This section of the tutorial largely comes from Dylan Bennett's excellent [Game
Development with PICO-8](https://mboffin.itch.io/gamedev-with-pico-8-issue1).

When you first run PICO-8, you start in a mode where you can type in commands.
From this mode you can type commands like save, load, and run. You can use the
command help to see what other commands you can run from this mode.

Use the **ESC** key to switch back and forth between editor mode and command
mode.  When you are playing a game and hit **ESC**, you'll come back to command
mode. Just hit **ESC** again to go into editor mode.

You'll find notes about each editor and shortcuts relevant to each on the
following pages. The shortcuts below are possible no matter which editor you
are currently using.

Shortcuts:

- **Alt-Right/Left** - Next/previous editor
- **Ctrl-S** - Save
- **Ctrl-R** - Run
- **Ctrl-M** - Mute/Unmute
- **Alt-Enter** - Fullscreen
- **Alt-F4, Ctrl-Q** - Quit

(Use Cmd instead of Ctrl on macOS.)
