## Source Code

Here is the full source code for this step. If you want your code to match what
is shown in the tutorial, everything after a `-->8` line should go in a new
tab. This is not necessary, but failure to do so will make your code harder to
navigate, reason about, and edit.

**Note:** The tool used to extract the full code listings does not properly
handle PICO-8's glyph characters. All glyph characters are replaced with an
`_`. You will need to manually replace them with the correct character.
