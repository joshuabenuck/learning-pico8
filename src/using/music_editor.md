# Music Editor

The Music Editor allows you to create patterns of music using the sounds from
the Sound Editor. Each pattern has four channels that can each contain a sound
from the Sound Editor.

Playback of patterns is controlled by the three buttons in the top-right (two
arrows and a square).  If the right-facing arrow is on, that marks a start
point. If the left-facing arrow is on, that marks a loop point. If the square
button is on, that marks a stop point.

Playback flows from the end of one pattern to the beginning of the next.
However, if playback reaches the end of a pattern and finds a loop point, it
will search backward until it finds a start point and play from there. If
playback reaches the end of a pattern and finds a stop point, playback will
stop.

## Shortcuts

- **Space** - Play/stop
- **- / +** - Go to previous/next pattern

**Note:** You can edit sounds in the Music Editor, so most Sound Editor
shortcuts also work here!

video tutorials about the sound and music editors!
